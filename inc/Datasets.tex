Datasets are crucial in developing and evaluating Text-to-SQL models for semantic parsing of natural language phrases. Various benchmark datasets are available, each with unique characteristics and features. Examples of early datasets include ATIS\cite{dahl-etal-1994-expanding}, GeoQuery\cite{10.1007/3-540-44795-4_40}, and Yelp\cite{10.1145/3133887}, which focus on a single topic and database. More recent datasets, such as WikiSQL\cite{zhong_seq2sql_2017} and Spider\cite{yu_spider_2019}, are larger and cover a broader range of domains.

These benchmark datasets provide a standardized testbed for evaluating the performance of Text-to-SQL models and are widely used in the research community. They vary in complexity, size, and annotation, allowing researchers to evaluate models' performance at different levels and scenarios. Additionally, new datasets include more advanced queries to assess the generalization capabilities of models. This chapter will review the complete benchmark datasets used in the Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing community and discuss their significance for the research community.

This chapter has reviewed various datasets widely used in the Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing community. These datasets vary in complexity, size, and annotation, providing a standardized testbed for evaluating the performance of Text-to-SQL models. We have discussed their unique characteristics and features from early datasets such as ATIS and GeoQuery to more recent datasets such as WikiSQL and Spider.
The datasets discussed in this chapter are a valuable resource for the research community to evaluate the progress and performance of Text-to-SQL models. The continued development and improvement of these datasets will be necessary for advancing the field of Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing.
The table\ref{tab:datasets} below provides an overview of the datasets mentioned in this chapter, including the number of queries and questions sorted by year.
