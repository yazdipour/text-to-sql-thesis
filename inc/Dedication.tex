\subsection*{Dedication}

I dedicate this thesis to the brave and heroic Iranian women who have stood up against oppression and fought for their rights and freedoms. These women, often at significant personal risk, have courageously spoken out against the injustices they have faced and have worked tirelessly to bring about positive change in their country.

Their tireless efforts and dedication to the cause of gender equality and social justice have inspired me and countless others worldwide. I am deeply grateful for their unwavering commitment to making the world a better place for all.

This thesis is also dedicated to the memory of those who have lost their lives in the struggle for equality and justice. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten, and their legacy will inspire future generations to fight for a more just and equitable world.
\\
Also, I express my deepest gratitude to my parents, who have always been my biggest supporters and have believed in me throughout my academic journey. Their love, guidance, and encouragement have been invaluable to me.
\\
Finally, I am also grateful to my professor, Prof. Patrick MÃ¤der and also Martin Hofmann, who has been excellent mentor and guide throughout the process of writing this thesis. Their expertise and support have been instrumental in helping me to complete this work.
