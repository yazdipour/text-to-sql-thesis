\subsection{Encoders}
\label{sec:encoders}

Several approaches have been explored to address the challenges of representing the meaning of questions, capturing the structure of database schemas, and establishing connections between database content and questions in the text-to-SQL domain. These methods play a crucial role in facilitating the understanding of the complex relationships between natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries.

One of the main challenges in text-to-SQL research is effectively representing the meaning of questions. Various encoding methods have been used to capture the semantics of natural language questions, ranging from traditional word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe to more advanced contextualized representations like BERT and its variants. These encoding techniques aim to produce meaningful vector representations of questions that models can use to understand and generate accurate SQL queries.

Another important aspect is representing database schemas, which serve as blueprints for organizing and structuring databases. Researchers have used various strategies to encapsulate database schema information, such as graph-based, tree-structured, and sequence-based encodings. These approaches enable text-to-SQL models to understand the hierarchical relationships and dependencies among various database elements. This allows for more accurate and efficient query generation.

Linking database content to questions is a vital task for text-to-SQL systems. It involves the identification and mapping of relevant entities and attributes from the question to the database schema. To achieve this, various methods have been employed, including attention mechanisms, entity-linking techniques, and schema-agnostic encodings. These approaches help models identify relevant portions of the database schema and generate SQL queries that accurately reflect the intended meaning of the natural language questions.

Encoding methods and encoders play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of representing question semantics, encapsulating database schema structures, and linking database content to questions in the text-to-SQL domain. The exploration of diverse encoding techniques has led to significant advancements in the development of more accurate and efficient text-to-SQL models, furthering the field's understanding of the complex relationships between natural language questions and SQL queries.
