\subsubsection{Multi-Lingual Large Scale Datasets}

In this study, we are only focusing on English datasets. Nevertheless, Researchers have produced several large-scale text-to-SQL datasets in diverse languages, such as CSpider\cite{min-etal-2019-pilot}, TableQA Sun et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2006-06434}, DuSQL Wang et al. (2020c) \cite{wang-etal-2020-dusql} in Chinese, ViText2SQL Tuan Nguyen et al. \cite{tuan-nguyen-etal-2020-pilot} in Vietnamese, and PortugueseSpider Jos√© and Cozman  in Portuguese\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2110-03546}. Human specialists primarily annotate these datasets based on the English Spider dataset, given that human translation is more accurate than machine translation Min et al. (2019a)\cite{min-etal-2019-pilot}. As such, these datasets have the potential to evolve into valuable resources in multi-lingual text-to-SQL studies.
