\subsubsection{MAS (Microsoft Academic Search)}

MAS, or Microsoft Academic Search\cite{roy2013the}, is a database of academic and social networks and a collection of queries. It has a total of 17 tables in its database, as well as 196 natural languages to SQL pairs. MAS can handle join, grouping, and nested queries but does not support ordering queries.

There are a few limitations to be aware of when using natural language queries within MAS. Firstly, all-natural language questions must begin with the phrase ”return me” and can not include an interrogative statement or a collection of keywords. Additionally, all queries must follow the proper grammatical conventions.
