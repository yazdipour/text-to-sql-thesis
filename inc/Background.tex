\section{Technical Background}

In this chapter, we provide background information about the technical concepts related to the main topics of this thesis, which focus on natural language understanding and text generation. We focus on early and recent approaches and the terminology needed to understand the basics of this thesis.

The text-to-SQL problem, or \ac{NL2SQL}, is the following: Given a Natural Language Query (NLQ) on a \ac{RDB}, produce a SQL query equivalent to the \ac{NLQ}. It has been a holy grail for the database community for over 30 years to translate user queries into SQL. Several challenges include ambiguity, schema linking, vocabulary gaps, and user errors.

Early approaches to Text-to-SQL relied on rule-based and template-based methods, while recent approaches use neural networks and machine learning techniques. This allows them to handle a wide range of natural language inputs and generate more accurate SQL queries, which we will discuss further.
