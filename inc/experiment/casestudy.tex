\section{Experiments}

Since the SEOSS Dataset\cite{RATH2019104005} has only been evaluated and trained with SQLNet and RatSQL, in this section, we aim to further explore its potential by conducting experiments using state-of-the-art methods currently proposed for the SPIDER challenge. To assess the effectiveness of these approaches, we compare the outcomes with those of SQLNet and RatSQL, as reported in the SEOSS-Queries research paper\cite{TOMOVA2022108211}. The findings from these experiments are detailed in the subsequent section, showcasing the capabilities of contemporary solutions in tackling the SPIDER task.

Additionally, taking advantage of the publicly available ChatGPT APIs, we decided to experiment with the ChatGPT model. Employing both the SPIDER and SEOSS datasets, we compared the results with those obtained from earlier experiments. The insights derived from these experiments are presented in the following section, further illustrating the potential of modern solutions in addressing the SPIDER task.

\subsection{Limitations}

Our experiment faced several limitations, primarily due to the extensive computational resources required when leveraging the T5 model. For our experiment, we used a single Nvidia RTX 3070 16GB GPU with 20GB Memory, which constrained us to smaller models with tighter restrictions. Despite these limitations, we managed to achieve admirable results. Utilizing a larger T5 model could have led to even higher scores. As a result, investing in a more powerful GPU for our experiment should be considered to capitalize on our model's potential fully.
In addition, during the ChatGPT experiment, cost constraints limited our ability to experiment with GPT-4.0, as its usage cost is approximately 30 times higher than that of GPT-3.5-turbo. We had to experiment with different methods to find the best prompt for ChatGPT to force him to act as a text-to-SQL agent, but this led to wasting money.
