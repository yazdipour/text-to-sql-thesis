\section{Experiments}

Since SEOSS Dataset\cite{RATH2019104005} was only evaluated and trained with SQLNet and RatSQL in this section, we decided to investigate further by experimenting with this dataset using state-of-the-art solutions currently proposed for the SPIDER challenge. In order to determine the effectiveness of these methods, we compared the results obtained with those of SQLNet\ref{sec:sqlnet} and RatSQL\ref{sec:ratsql} from the SEOSS-Queries research paper\cite{TOMOVA2022108211}. The results of these experiments are presented in the following section, and they will demonstrate the potential of modern solutions for solving the SPIDER task.

\subsection{Limitations}

Our experiment requires a lot of computational resources as we mainly leverage the T5 model. We used a single Nvidia RTX 3070 16GB GPU with 40GB Memory for our experiment, which unfortunately limited us to smaller models with more restrictions. Despite these limitations, we were still able to achieve excellent results. If we had used a larger T5 model, such as T5-3B, we would have been able to reach much higher scores. Therefore, investing in a more powerful GPU for our experiment is something that we must consider in order to maximize our results.
